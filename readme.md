# Commons for KISSCMS

This plugin adds client-side resources from [Commons](http://github.com/commons) to the templates. 

## Usage

After copying the contents of this plugin in the ```PLUGINS``` location the ```common.css``` and ```common.js``` are going to be referenced in all the templates. 

Note that the default file locations are hosted at ```cdn.kdi.co``` and will work for ```localhost``` but only with the [KDI network](http://kdi.co) in production.

You can login to the administration to change the URLs of the files.
